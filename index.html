        <h2>This website showcases my journey in learning the fundamentals to graphic design and basic website design in HTML/CSS. Admittedly, this journey was intimidating, both due to my deep hatred for coding and my complete novelty in regards to it. Learning the foundations to CSS has been incredibly easy due to w3schools.com which I will reference at the bottom of the website. I had some previous graphic design experience, however, I was never previously limited to specific styles. Exploring these was pretty fun. The challenge was using InDesign and Illustrator. I had no knowledge of how to navigate these, and so making the projects was tough, especially at the very start. I probably should have looked up tutorials, but learning both software entirely on my own was interesting in its own way.</h2>
        <h2>If I had more time I would have liked to explore more website functions. I think I made the hover overlay on images well, even though that was the most challenging part of creating my website. I originally was planning to have the images quite plain; no slight rounded edges, and no shadow. I did think this made the website look rather boring, so I implemented those changes and I managed to do this with no issues. I would have liked to make the title of this page more bold and/or interesting, but I failed to find anything besides the traditional font families that I could use in CSS to style it better, hence I settled on the rounded border around it to separate it from all the other text. To try keep it simple, I opted out of making a separate page for each project, and instead made very simple buttons that direct the reader to each section on the page. When adjusting and adding code I struggled a bit with where to put them within my existing code, this is where I asked ChatGPT for help. This was the only extent that I have used AI for, the rest was pretty straightforward so it'd be embarrassing if I had to use it for anything else. I would have liked to potentially use my (limited) JS knowledge to make something more visually pleasing for the background, but I feel like this would have been too complex for me to execute properly, so I made it a gradient instead.</h2>
        <h2>I hope you enjoy looking through this page, where I have included all my final work, and a further reflection for each piece. Clicking on the images allows you to view them in full size.</h2>

            <div class="grid-item" id="carp">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Contrast_Poster.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Contrast_Poster.jpg" alt="Contrast Poster">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Contrast</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I chose the theatre mask to relate it to the theme of the poster - this also shows contrast in expression. I created this image in Krita. For further contrast I have used a black background and bold red writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Alignment.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Alignment</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I have struggled filling this poster out as there was limited text. I decided to use the sponsors from the official website as this would often be seen on real posters. I have aligned the big text towards the edges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Repetition_Poster.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Repetition_Poster.jpg" alt="Repetition Poster">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Repetition</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I have decided to use repetition for the backgroud of this piece. I have cut this off at the bottom to make the rest of the text easier to read.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Proximity.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Proximity.jpg" alt="Proximity">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Proximity</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I thought a good use of the text would be to make it into a shape, so I made the title of the event into a question mark. This is used as a centre piece for the poster, making it large and eye catching. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>
    <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item" id="typography">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Axial.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Axial.jpg" alt="Axial">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Axial</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>I enjoyed making this piece, although I wasn't aware of the rotation tool, so I massively struggled with rotating each textbox using the options section. This would have been a lot easier if I knew what I know now. Axial system means all elements are arranged on either side of an axis or line. I have implemented this by having slanted text reach the corners of the page, and placing the rest of the text on either side of it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Radial.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Radial.jpg" alt="Radial">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Radial</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Radial system means all elements are organized to extend from a central point of focus like rays. Therefore, I made the poster look like a sun. I struggled with the direction of the text and making it fit well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Dilatational.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Dilatational.jpg" alt="Dilatational">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Dilatational</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In the dilatational system, circles dilate or expand from a central point. I made mine into a spiral - similar to a snail shell. I broke the text up using different colours to make it more readable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Random.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Random.jpg" alt="Random">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Random</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The random system kind of speaks for itself - it's about organising the elements of the poster completely randomly. This was the least challenging piece, and I enjoyed the creative freedom.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Grid.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Grid.jpg" alt="Grid">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Grid</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>A grid system consists of horizontal and vertical lines that guide the layout ideas. Although my grid is not outright visible, I have used the grid option in Illustrator to help me with the design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Modular.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Modular.jpg" alt="Modular">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Modular</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In the modular system there is usually a common theme of same or similar shapes throughout the design. This was the easiest way of organising the text. Least amount of effort for most effective display.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Transitional.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Transitional.jpg" alt="Transitional">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Transitional</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The main part of the transitional system is wavy, 'organic' feel to the text. I used this oportunity to create waves of text next to simple shapes, creating a minimalistic scene. I didn't want to over use this though - so I included some straight text. The shorter text serves as the little birds flying above the waves.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="./Bilateral.jpg" target="_blank"></a>
                    <img class="image" src="Bilateral.jpg" alt="Bilateral">
                    <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text">Bilateral</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Symmetry is quite important in the bilateral system. I arranged two of the longer paragraphs as separate mirrored units. I experimented a bit with the top section, I thought it would look interesting if I split up the event location's text and had two of the shorter sentences on each side. I also played with the font size to make the text look more uniform.</p>
